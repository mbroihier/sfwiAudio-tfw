Test was executed with the same setup and immediate following the execution of test case FINISH-0020.  Initially I pressed the back key to halt the playing of the current podcast.  Then I selected the same podcast.  A new display appeared that had a progress bar and PAUSE button.  Audio was playing.  I pressed the PAUSE button and the button label became RESUME.  The audio stopped and the progress bar paused.  I then pressed the RESUME button and the audio resumed and the progress bar continued.

This test case was executed immediately following the execution of test case CONTROLS-0020.  I started by pressing the back button to terminate the podcast currently playing.  I then started playing the second podcast again.  It started playing from the last pause I did.  I have to think about whether or not this is intended behavior.  I moved the slider forward (about 2/3rd's of the travel distance).  I moved the slider to the beginning of the podcast and heard the introduction monologue.  Let the podcast play to about 1/3.  Went back about 1/2 the distance.  This audio had been played before.  Then I advanced to nearly 1/3 and it was audio later in time but not to where I had stopped.

The display was blank - the app must not have reread the podcast directory.  This is an error, but not the point of the test case, however I will fail the case so that I will remember to change this behavior.  I halted the app from the task list and started it again.  The 5 podcasts were displayed.  I was able to start each podcast and terminate it by pressing the back key.

I started this test case immediately following PERFORMANCE-0010.  I loaded up another 5 podcasts and restarted the app from the main menu.  Again, the list did not refresh so I terminated and restarted the app as I did when I executed PERFORMANCE-0010.  I will not fail this test case for this bad behavior since it is noted in PERFORMANCE-0010 and it is not the objective of this test.  I was able to start all 10 podcasts.  I then loaded another 10.  Again the list didn't update and I terminated and restarted the app.  Then all 20 podcasts were displayed.  I was able to start all 20 podcasts.

Version 1.3 APK has been developed and published that addresses the problem with rereading the local podcast directory.  Now transitioning into the main menu should reread the directory and display its current contents.  I started this test with contents of 20 podcasts.  These displayed correctly and play seemed reasonable.  Then I deleted them all.  I selected a podcast from the list, the sub menu played nothing and when I returned to the main menu with the back key I got the message, "There are no podcasts in the podcast directory".  This seems reasonable.  Then I loaded 5 podcasts into the podcast directory (step 1 of the procedure).  The display did not change on its own, that wasn't expected.  I pressed the home key and started the app again and got the message that said the directory was empty - it apparently didn't reread it then, but when I selected the podcast and went back to the podcast list, the 5 podcasts appeared and I was able to select each of them.  This is better, I don't have to halt the task, but I'd really like it to display the refreshed list any time I enter the main menu.  I'm going to fail this one again.

Update 1.3 has a change to terminate the playing of a podcast properly and return to the main menu when the podcast completes.  The cause of this was the use of a stale activity.  I started this test immediately following the execution of PERFORMANCE-0010 when I had 5 podcasts in on the Android 7.1.2 Nexus 6P device.  I loaded a short podcast so that I had 6 podcasts on the device and refreshed the list by starting the play of a podcast and then went back to the main menu.  The added podcast was displayed.  I then started it.  It terminated normally and went back to the main menu list.  I then started the other 5 podcasts and advanced them to near the end and let them complete.  When they completed, they all returned to the main menu.

This test was executed immediately following the execution of CONTROLS-0020 using the Moto G phone.  Starting from the playing podcast.  I moved the slider to the beginning of the slider and toggled the pause resume button.  Then I pressed the back button and then I pressed the home key.  From the main menu, I started the test case at step 1.  The main menu was presented and I selected the podcast.  It started playing the podcast at the beginning (where I had moved the progress bar and toggled the pause/resume button).  I moved the slider forward.  The audio does seem to advance.  Then I moved the slider back to the beginning.  The introduction of the podcast started playing.  I let the podcast play until about 1/4 of it played (based on the slider bar).  I moved it to about 1/8th the travel and verified I had heard this audio.  Then I advanced the bar just a bit.  The audio that played was after the audio I was just listening to but before the audio I was listening to at about the 1/4 position.  The slider seems to be working as intuitively expected.

This test was executed following CONTROLS-0030 (10/31/2017).  Before this test, I exited the app.  Then I executed step 1 which was loading 5 podcasts.  I then started the app.  Only one podcast was displayed - the one I had been playing previously.  I selected it, it started playing and then I hit the back button.  At that point, all 5 of the podcasts were listed.  I was able to select all 5 podcasts and they all played and terminated as expected when I hit the back button.

Again, due to the wrong initial display after loading new podcasts, I'm failing this test case.

I started this test case immediately following PERMFORMANCE-0020 on the Moto G running Android 4.4.2.  Like last time, I exited the app and then installed 5 more podcasts so that it held 10 podcasts.  When I started, I had 10 podcasts displayed which surprised me a bit - I had expected 5 because I hadn't expected the list to have been updated (like last time with PERFORMANCE-0010).  10 is correct value, so that is good, but...  I was able to select all 10 podcasts and the back key terminated them when pressed.  I then added 10 more podcasts.  I exited the app using the back key twice.  I did this while the podcasts were loading. When the loading finished, I started the app.  There were 20 podcasts displayed.  I could start all of them and terminate them with the back key.

This test case executed completely as expected.  At the moment, I'm not sure why PERFORMANCE-0010 has failed consistently.  I need to investigate why the list isn't always updating after using Android File Transfer to load the files.
