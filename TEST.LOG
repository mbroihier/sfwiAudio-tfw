Test was executed with the same setup and immediate following the execution of test case FINISH-0020.  Initially I pressed the back key to halt the playing of the current podcast.  Then I selected the same podcast.  A new display appeared that had a progress bar and PAUSE button.  Audio was playing.  I pressed the PAUSE button and the button label became RESUME.  The audio stopped and the progress bar paused.  I then pressed the RESUME button and the audio resumed and the progress bar continued.

This test was executed immediately following CONTROLS-0010 with the same Android phone.  I started by pressing the back button and then continued to step 1.  This time I selected the second podcast, 01 The Moth Radio Hour_Me, Myself, and I_Stories of Questioned Identity.mp3.  That podcast started.  Let the podcast run for a while and then pressed PAUSE.  Pressed RESUME and the audio resumed from the place it was paused.  The progress bar continued.

This test case was executed immediately following the execution of test case CONTROLS-0020.  I started by pressing the back button to terminate the podcast currently playing.  I then started playing the second podcast again.  It started playing from the last pause I did.  I have to think about whether or not this is intended behavior.  I moved the slider forward (about 2/3rd's of the travel distance).  I moved the slider to the beginning of the podcast and heard the introduction monologue.  Let the podcast play to about 1/3.  Went back about 1/2 the distance.  This audio had been played before.  Then I advanced to nearly 1/3 and it was audio later in time but not to where I had stopped.
Results: PASSED
