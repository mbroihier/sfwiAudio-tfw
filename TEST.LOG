Using the same test setup as STARTUP-0020 test that was run previous to this test case.  I selected, the first podcast labeled 01 #628_In the Shadow of the City 2017.mp3.  Title on the sub menu says it is playing the correct podcast.  Audio sounds right with the title.  There is a progress bar and there is a PAUSE button.

Test was executed with the same setup and immediate following the execution of test case FINISH-0020.  Initially I pressed the back key to halt the playing of the current podcast.  Then I selected the same podcast.  A new display appeared that had a progress bar and PAUSE button.  Audio was playing.  I pressed the PAUSE button and the button label became RESUME.  The audio stopped and the progress bar paused.  I then pressed the RESUME button and the audio resumed and the progress bar continued.

This test was executed immediately following CONTROLS-0010 with the same Android phone.  I started by pressing the back button and then continued to step 1.  This time I selected the second podcast, 01 The Moth Radio Hour_Me, Myself, and I_Stories of Questioned Identity.mp3.  That podcast started.  Let the podcast run for a while and then pressed PAUSE.  Pressed RESUME and the audio resumed from the place it was paused.  The progress bar continued.

Log data:
This test case was executed immediately following the execution of test case CONTROLS-0020.  I started by pressing the back button to terminate the podcast currently playing.  I then started playing the second podcast again.  It started playing from the last pause I did.  I have to think about whether or not this is intended behavior.  I moved the slider forward (about 2/3rd's of the travel distance).  I moved the slider to the beginning of the podcast and heard the introduction monologue.  Let the podcast play to about 1/3.  Went back about 1/2 the distance.  This audio had been played before.  Then I advanced to nearly 1/3 and it was audio later in time but not to where I had stopped.
Results: PASSED

Using Android 7.1.2 on a Nexus 6P with two podcasts installed, I selected the second podcast named 01 The Moth Radio Hour_Me, Myself, and I_Stories of Questioned Identity.mp3.  I let it run to the end.  When the play finished, it did not return to the main menu.  Note, I have seen it return, so I do know that sometimes it works.

Deleted app from Nexus 6P phone running 7.1.2.  Deleted podcasts from phone's directory.  Then I installed the app using Android Studio.  Upon start, it presented the message, "There are no podcasts in the podcast directory or you have not given the app permission to access external storage."  This is correct, but I noticed something that has caused me to write an additional test case, STARTUP-0030.
Results: PASSED

Started immediately after execution of test case STARTUP-0030.  I pressed the home button and installed 5 podcasts. Started the app from the main Android menu.  The display was blank - the app must not have reread the podcast directory.  This is an error, but not the point of the test case, however I will fail the case so that I will remember to change this behavior.  I halted the app from the task list and started it again.  The 5 podcasts were displayed.  I was able to start each podcast and terminate it by pressing the back key.
Results: FAILED

Log data:
I started this test case immediately following PERFORMANCE-0010.  I loaded up another 5 podcasts and restarted the app from the main menu.  Again, the list did not refresh so I terminated and restarted the app as I did when I executed PERFORMANCE-0010.  I will not fail this test case for this bad behavior since it is noted in PERFORMANCE-0010 and it is not the objective of this test.  I was able to start all 10 podcasts.  I then loaded another 10.  Again the list didn't update and I terminated and restarted the app.  Then all 20 podcasts were displayed.  I was able to start all 20 podcasts.
